                            <h6>The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), headed by the Prime Minister of
                                India, is the apex body for Disaster Management in India. Setting up of NDMA and the
                                creation of an enabling environment for institutional mechanisms at the State and
                                District levels is mandated by the Disaster Management Act, 2005. NDMA is mandated to
                                lay down the policies, plans and guidelines for Disaster Management. India envisions the
                                development of an ethos of Prevention, Mitigation, Preparedness and Response.

                                The Indian government strives to promote a national resolve to mitigate the damage and
                                destruction caused by natural and man-made disasters, through sustained and collective
                                efforts of all Government agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations and People’s
                                participation. This is planned to be accomplished by adopting a Technology-Driven,
                                Pro-Active, Multi-Hazard and Multi-Sectoral strategy for building a Safer, Disaster
                                Resilient and Dynamic India.

                                The NDMA Logo reflects the aspirations of this National Vision, of empowering all
                                stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of Disaster Management in India. NDMA has 5
                                major divisions viz. Policy & Plans, Mitigation , Operations & Communications &
                                Information & Technology , Administration and Finance.
                                <br><br>
                                The Handbook is divided into six main themes that are broadly aligned with the functions
                                of an On-Site Operations Coordination Centre (OSOCC). Each theme is divided into
                                chapters that are written as stand-alone documents, referencing material across all
                                themes.

                                phase of a sudden-onset emergency. UNDAC also assists in the coordination of incoming
                                international relief at national level and/or at the site of the emergency. UNDAC was
                                created in 1993 and currently is composed by 259 national experts in emergency
                                situations, as well as by OCHA personnel and regional and international organizations,
                                including UN agencies.

                                The responsibility of managing disasters in India is that of the State Government. The ‘Nodal Ministry’ in the central government for management of natural disasters is the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).
                                
                                When 'calamities of severe nature' occur, the Central Government is responsible for providing aid and assistance to the affected state, including deploying, at the State's request, of Armed Forces, Central Paramilitary Forces, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and such communication, air and other assets, as are available and needed.
                                National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) is under the National Disaster Management Authority.The head of the NDRF is designated as Director General. The Director Generals of NDRF are IPS officers on deputation from Indian police organizations. Director General is a three-star officer.
                                
                                The NDRF is a top-heavy organization which in addition to the Director General has several Inspector Generals (IG) and Deputy IGs, who are flag officers and wear badges of rank.

                                The aim of the National Disaster Management Authority is to build a safer and disaster resilient India by developing a holistic, proactive, multi-disaster and technology driven strategy for disaster management. This has to be achieved through a culture of prevention, mitigation and preparedness to generate a prompt and efficient response at the time of disasters. This national vision inter alia, aims at inculcating a culture of preparedness among all stakeholders.

                                NDRF has proved its importance in achieving this vision by highly skilled rescue and relief operations, regular and intensive training and re-training, familiarization exercises within the area of responsibility of respective NDRF Battalions, carrying out mock drills and joint exercises with the various stakeholders.<br><br>
                                <h2><b>SDRF</b></h2>
                                
                                As per Section 3.4.5 of National Policy on Disaster Management 2009, the State Governments are required to raise their own SDRF for quickly responding to disasters.

As per information available, 24 State/UTs have raised their SDRF. These SDRF are placed strategically at suitable locations well connected to the airport, rail heads and roads for their immediate deployment at the disaster sites.

The SDRF are also be used for Community Capacity Building and Awareness Generation programmes within the State. During these programmes, SDRF can familiarize themselves with terrain, critical buildings and other existing infrastructure for prompt responses at the time of disasters and simultaneously work with the community, including school children, village volunteers and other stakeholders on what to do during disasters.
